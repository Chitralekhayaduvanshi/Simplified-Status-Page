# Simplified Status Page Application

A real-time status page application built with React, TypeScript, and modern web technologies. Monitor your services, manage incidents, and provide transparent status updates to your users.

# Learnings:

* I started with Cursor and using the composer which has in built Claude Sonnet 3.5, also intergrating the V0 from Vercel generating high-quality UIs and code.
* Now with proper modification as per the requirements conculded with a github repository.
* Finally deployed my application using Vercel.
